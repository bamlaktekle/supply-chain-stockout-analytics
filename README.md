# Supply Chain Stockout Analytics

## 1. Business Problem

Retailers and distributors lose money when popular products go out of stock or sit in the wrong warehouses.  
The goal of this project is to **identify which products and warehouses are riskiest, estimate the revenue at risk from stockouts, and evaluate supplier performance**, using an analytics-engineering style pipeline.

This is a simulated but realistic analytics project designed to showcase data analytics and analytics engineering skills for roles like Data Analyst, Analytics Engineer, and Data/Cloud SWE.

## 2. Data & Modeling

### Synthetic Dataset

All data is generated with Python to resemble a mid‑size retailer:

- **Sales**
  - ~500 sales transactions
  - ~200 SKUs (`Widget-001` …) across multiple customer segments
  - Fields: `order_id`, `product_id`, `order_date`, `quantity_sold`, `revenue`, `customer_segment`
- **Inventory**
  - Daily inventory snapshots over 90 days
  - 4 warehouses (e.g., LA-West, LA-East, Chicago, Dallas)
  - Fields: `product_id`, `warehouse_id`, `snapshot_date`, `stock_on_hand`, `reorder_point`, `safety_stock`
- **Lead times / suppliers**
  - ~200 product–supplier relationships
  - Fields: `product_id`, `supplier_id`, `avg_lead_days`, `reliability_score`, `cost_per_unit`

### BigQuery Tables

Raw data is stored in Google BigQuery:

- `raw_sales`
- `raw_inventory`
- `raw_lead_times`

### Analytics Views (Model Layer)

Analytics-ready views are built on top of the raw tables:

- `vw_inventory_risk`  
  Product/warehouse‑level **stockout risk scores**  
  - `risk_days`, `total_days`, `risk_rate` per `(product_id, warehouse_id)`
- `vw_lost_revenue_estimates`  
  Product‑level **potential lost revenue**, approximated by joining low‑stock inventory snapshots to trailing 7‑day sales
- `vw_supplier_performance`  
  Supplier‑level **reliability and cost metrics**  
  - `num_products`, `avg_lead_days`, `avg_reliability`, `avg_cost_per_unit` per `supplier_id`

These views are the primary sources used by Looker Studio.

## 3. Architecture

High‑level pipeline:

1. **Data generation (Python)**
   - `generate_data.py` creates `raw_sales.csv`, `raw_inventory.csv`, and `raw_lead_times.csv`.
2. **Ingestion (BigQuery)**
   - CSVs are loaded into `supply_chain_raw.raw_*` tables.
3. **Modeling (BigQuery SQL)**
   - `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` statements define `vw_inventory_risk`, `vw_lost_revenue_estimates`, and `vw_supplier_performance`.
4. **Visualization (Looker Studio)**
   - Looker Studio connects directly to the `vw_*` views for live dashboards.
